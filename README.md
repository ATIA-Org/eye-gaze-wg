# ATIA Eye Gaze Standards Working Group

The Eye Gaze Standards Working Group focuses on eye gaze technology and how eye gaze applications interact with eye gaze systems (cameras, mouse/keyboard emulation, etc). For this effort to be successful, input from a wide variety of players in the eye gaze development world is required.

Our first meeting was held at the ATIA 2024 Conference, January 25th in Orlando Florida USA.  Our second meeting will be held over Zoom on Feb 29th, 2024.

This group is open to ATIA members and non-members.  To join the working group, please visit [the working group sign up page](https://www.atia.org/eye-gaze-standards-working-group/).

## Overarching goal of this group

This working group will collaborate on the process by which eye gaze aware applications can recognize, cooperate, and interact with each other. As a novel technology which does not have established interoperability semantics, additional guidelines are needed to ensure an integrated outcome for users of eye gaze systems who have multiple products from different authors and companies installed on the same device.
