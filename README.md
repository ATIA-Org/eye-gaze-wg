# ATIA Eye Gaze Standards Working Group

ATIA is creating a standards working group that will focus on eye gaze technology and how third-party developers interact with various eye gaze systems. For this effort to be successful, input from a wide variety of players in the eye gaze development space is required.

Jay Beavers from Tolt Technologies will host an initial meeting at ATIA 2024, January 25th @ 1 PM EST available both in person at the conference center and over Zoom.
This group is open to ATIA members and non-members.  To RSVP, please visit [the working group sign up page](https://www.atia.org/eye-gaze-standards-working-group/).

## Overarching goal of this group

This working group will collaborate on the process by which eye gaze aware applications can recognize, cooperate, and interact with each other. As a novel technology which does not have established interoperability semantics, additional guidelines and interaction patterns are needed to ensure an integrated outcome for users of eye gaze systems who have multiple products from different authors and companies installed on the same device.
