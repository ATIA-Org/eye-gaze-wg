## Meeting Notes
### Bylaw Review
Bylaws were reviewed and approved with a plan for ammendments at future meetings. Specific areas for review include
- Adjustments to the name and purpose of the working group
- Consider expanding purpose to include HID standard. Initial interest in investigating expressed by Pete, Marcus, Jon, Travis and Shea.

### IP and Licensing Review
(../../LICENSE) was reviewed and approved.

### Eye Gaze Aware Specification
General discussion regarding the existing specification. Primary feedback related to the current draft specification being too platform specific. Request was for the proposed specification to be more platform agnostic. 

### Privacy and Ethics
Affirmation that taking privacy and ethics into account is important. Proposed to have each subgroup keep these issues in mind as they work on their specific areas.

### Other Sub-Groups
Discussion of the need for sub-groups to address specific areas of interest. The following sub-groups were proposed and had traction:
- Eye Gaze Aware Specification (Jay Beavers leading)
- HID Standard and OS Integration (Jon Campbell leading)

### Schedule Next Meeting
Schedule next meeting: March 28, 2024, 7 AM PST on Zoom. In general we will meet on the 4th Thursday of the month at 7 AM PST.
